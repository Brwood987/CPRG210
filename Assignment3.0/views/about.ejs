            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>ÿellowcake is a dynamic band that blends harsh, angry political edge with ear-worm hooks and boyish good looks, 
                ÿellowcake humbly accepts responsibility for any instances of moshing, boogieing, or any general head nodding/toe tapping situations..</p>
            
            <h2>Humble beginings</h2>
            <p>Formed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and making waves in the indie scene with their proprietary genre,
                Poo-Gazé, the ÿellowcake boys have massed an audience in the singular thousand.</p>
            
            <h2>Meet the Band</h2>
            <p>Of all their positive qualities, the only one that outshines their modesty is their musical ability.
                With the energetic and emotional vocals of frontman and guitarist Markus Zerr, combined with the blinding speed
                and precision of guitarist Brett Pennington, the strings do their things across all ÿellowcake's tracks.
                Supported by the rhythmic foundation of drummer Ben Wood's skillful technicality and eclectic flair,
                bassist Evan Watt guides the groove with booming tone and melodic riffs. This majesty is bridled and undergirded by their legendary manager Aarronthall James.
                An enigmatic cypher of a man, his cerebral superpowers tame these wild man-horses and maintain strict standards of excellence for all things behind the scenes.</p>
